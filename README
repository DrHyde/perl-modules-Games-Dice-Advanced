This module simulates dice rolls, both for normal dice, for dice with
weird numbers of sides, and dice with uneven probability distributions.
There are many different ways of tweaking the distribution.

Because this module is dealing with random data, it is not practical to
test it in a deterministic way.  The tests *should* pass, but if they
don't, please try again.  If you get any particular test failing
consistently, then please let me know.  Any more detailed investigations
you can do would be useful.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
